        Hi, I'm Anika Cave. I am currently a senior at Cornell University pursuing a degree
        in Computer Science with a minor in Physics. I enjoy solving quantitative problems relating
        to machine learning, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. In particular, I am currently
        exploring through my coursework, interests in networks, differential privacy, stochastic processes,
        signal processing, and operating systems. <br></br><br></br>
        In my free time, I enjoy reading books, spending time outside, and enjoying the rest of my college days with my friends!
        After graduation, I plan on moving to New York City where I look forward to spending much of my time in museums, coffee shops, and parks.
